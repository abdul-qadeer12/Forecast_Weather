"# Forecast_Weather" 

🚀 **Excited to Share My Latest React Native Project: The Ultimate Weather App!** 📝

√ **Implemented Core Components**: Utilized `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks for managing state and side effects, alongside local storage for user preferences.

√ **App Flow**: Developed a multi-screen app with a robust user interface:
- **HomeScreen**: Features a search bar to select and view weather data for different locations.
- **Weather Details**: Displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- **Daily Forecast**: Shows a scrollable view of daily weather forecasts with corresponding icons.

√ **Key Features**:
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for cities and see real-time weather updates.
- **Local Storage**: Saves user-selected cities using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for persistent state.
- **Loading Indicator**: Displays a loading spinner using `react-native-progress` while fetching data.
- **Icons**: Utilized `react-native-heroicons` for modern and versatile icons throughout the app.

√ **Explore the Project**:
- **Navigation**: Implemented smooth navigation between screens using [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/hello-react-navigation).
- **Iconography**: Added dynamic icons with `react-native-heroicons` and `react-native-svg`.
- **Local Storage**: Managed local data storage with `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.
